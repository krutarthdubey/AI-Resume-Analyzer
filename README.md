An AI-powered *Flask web application* that analyzes resumes using *Natural Language Processing (NLP)* to compare them with job descriptions and calculate a *match score*. The tool helps job seekers tailor their resumes for better alignment with specific roles.

- Paste a job description  
- Get an instant match score (0‚Äì100%)  
- Receive feedback on how to improve resume relevance  
- Simple and responsive UI built with Bootstrap  

Tech Stack
- Backend: Flask  
- NLP Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn  
- PDF Parsing: PyPDF2  
- Frontend: HTML, Bootstrap  
- Similarity Measure: TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
